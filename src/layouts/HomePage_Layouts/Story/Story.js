                non-corrupt animal shelters all over the U.S. to partner with so

                needed to run current and additional animal shelters as well as
                provide the equipment, food, water, needed to do so. These
                proceeds will additionally provide for the medical procedures
                and equipment needed to bring these helpless animals from poor
                health back to tip top shape in order to prep them for adoption.
