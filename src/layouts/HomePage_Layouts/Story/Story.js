              Kitten Clubhouse was conceived to be not just a normal cat NFT set
              that you and your grandma see every other day of the week. It‚Äôs
              meant to cultivate the power of it‚Äôs community to do actual good
              in the physical world, and eventually, the metaverse alike.{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="font-cream-shoes fs-38px weight-5 mb-50px lh-1">
              üêà We also really love animals‚Ä¶like REALLY love animals, cats too

              So that‚Äôs where we started‚Ä¶we made a bunch of friggin cats‚Ä¶about
              10,000 of them .
            </p>
            <p className="font-cream-shoes fs-38px weight-5 mb-50px lh-1">
              From there we made one of the main pivots of our set to help save
              the lives of cats, kittens, and other animals all around through
              official partners with the proceeds made off of the sales of this
              set! We did our due diligence to research and find authentic,
              legitimate, transparent, non-euthanizing, and non-corrupt animal
              shelters all over the U.S. to partner with so that funds are
              allocated to the right places.

            <p className="font-cream-shoes fs-38px weight-5 mb-50px lh-1">
              These funds will help our cute, furry friends by providing funds
              for the care of homeless animals to prevent them from being
              euthanized and to help them find a proper home, pay for expenses
              needed to run current and additional animal shelters as well as
              provide the equipment, food, water, needed to do so. These
              proceeds will additionally provide for the medical procedures and
              equipment needed to bring these helpless animals from poor health
              back to tip top shape in order to prep them for adoption. You can

              Community is something that takes time to grow, time to cultivate,

              HODLers will have more than their fair share of exclusive content,
